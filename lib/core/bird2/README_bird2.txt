1. Name: YunFan Zhou (yz23926), Alejandro Rodriguez (aar3772)
2. Compile and Run using the exact same command as the code base
3. No special instructions
4. All the specs are fulfilled as expected
5. Penalty force visually is the same as the reference. However, when testing with 
the test script, the numerical results are different beyond margin of error. We
think this may be because the nondeterministic nature of tetgen that we talked about
in office hours relsults in differences between our data and the reference's.
